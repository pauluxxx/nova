<h1>Cartesian Widget</h1>

<p>
    The Cartesian Widget provides a graphical interface for visualizing and manipulating
    data within a Cartesian coordinate system. It allows users to plot points, draw shapes,
    and perform various transformations such as scaling and translation. The widget
    displays a grid representing the Cartesian plane, with labeled axes (x-axis and y-axis) for
    easy reference. Users can interact with the widget to input data points, adjust settings,
    and analyze relationships between variables. It's a versatile tool for tasks such as graphing
    mathematical functions, plotting data points, and creating geometric illustrations.
